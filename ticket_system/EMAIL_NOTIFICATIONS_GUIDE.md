   - Check admin emails

2. **Ticket Updated**

   - Check assignee's email

4. **Comment Added**

---

## 🎛️ User Preferences

Users can control these settings at `/profile/notifications`:

- ✉️ **Email Enabled** (Master Switch)
- 🎫 **Ticket Created** - When they create a ticket
- 👨‍💼 **Ticket Assigned** - When assigned to them
- 🔄 **Status Changed** - When ticket status changes

---

## 📊 Notification Tracking

Every email is logged with:
- **User ID** - Who was notified
- **Type** - What kind of notification
- **Status** - sent, failed, or skipped
- **Timestamp** - When it was sent
- **Error** - If it failed, why

Admins can view this in the dashboard at `/admin/notifications`

---

## 🔍 How It Works Internally

### Workflow
```
1. User Action (create ticket, comment, etc.)
   ↓
2. API Route Handler
   ↓
3. Database Update
   ↓
4. Notification Service Called
   ↓
5. Check User Preferences (should notify?)
   ↓
6. Generate HTML Email from Template
   ↓
7. Send via SMTP (Nodemailer)
   ↓
8. Log Result to Notification Collection
   ↓
9. Return Success/Failure
```

### Smart Features
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Same user won't get multiple emails for the same action
- **Actor Exclusion**: Person who triggered action doesn't get notified
- **Preference Checking**: Respects user's notification settings
- **Error Handling**: Failed emails don't crash the system
- **Audit Trail**: Everything logged for debugging

---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **No Password Exposure** - `.env.local` is gitignored
2. **App Password Used** - Gmail app password (not main password)
3. **Preferences Protected** - Users can only change their own
4. **Admin Only History** - Only admins can view notification logs
5. **Security Alerts** - Profile changes include security warning

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Emails Arriving?

1. **Check SMTP Credentials**
   ```bash
   node test-email.js
   ```

2. **Check User Preferences**
   - Visit `/profile/notifications`
   - Ensure "Email Enabled" is ON

3. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for `[notificationService]` logs
   - Look for `[mail]` warnings

4. **Check Spam Folder**
   - Emails might be filtered

### Emails Marked as Skipped?

- User has disabled that notification type in preferences
- User has master email switch OFF
- Check admin dashboard for details

### Check Notification History

Visit `/admin/notifications` to see:
- Which emails were sent
- Which failed or were skipped
- Error messages for failures

---
