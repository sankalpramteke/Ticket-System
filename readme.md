# Ticket System

Simple tool to report tech issues on campus and track them to closure.

### Problem statement (PS)
Campus teams need a simple way to raise, track, and close IT issues with clear ownership and timely updates. The system should enforce complete requests, support assignment and status changes, and notify stakeholders reliably.

### Why
- To make it easy for anyone to raise a request.
- To keep assignees and admins in sync without chasing chats.
- To have a single place to see status and history.

### What
- Create tickets with required details: `Name`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Description`, `Room/Lab`, `Department`.
- Track lifecycle: assign, change priority, resolve, close. Everything is logged.
- Get emails on create and on updates (reporter + admins).

### How
- Go to `/tickets/new`, fill the form, submit.
- Admin assigns or updates status/priority.
- System logs activities and sends emails.

### Recommended design pattern
Adopt a layered (clean) architecture that fits the Next.js App Router while keeping the codebase small and maintainable.

- **Presentation (UI/API)** ‚Äî `src/app/**`
  - Pages and API route handlers only coordinate requests/responses.
  - No business rules here; defer to services.
- **Application (Services / Use-cases)** ‚Äî `src/services/`
  - Implements use-cases: create ticket, assign, update status/priority, send notifications.
  - Depends on domain models and infrastructure via small functions (no circular deps).
- **Domain (Models / Types)** ‚Äî `src/models/`
  - Mongoose schemas for `Ticket`, `User`, `Activity`.
  - Validation and indexes close to data.
- **Infrastructure (Adapters)** ‚Äî `src/lib/`
  - DB connection (`db.js`), mail (`mail.js`), auth (`jwt.js`), events (`events.js`).

Suggested layout:
```text
src/
  app/                 # Presentation (UI + API routes)
  models/              # Domain models (Ticket, User, Activity)
  services/            # Application layer (TicketService, NotificationService)
  lib/                 # Infrastructure (db, mail, auth, events)
  components/          # UI components
```

Why this fits:
- Keeps UI/API thin; logic is testable in services.
- Clear boundaries make SMTP/DB changes low-risk.
- Scales from a single repo without over-engineering.

Alternatives considered:
- **Fat API routes only**: faster to start, but mixes concerns, harder to test.
- **Microservices**: unnecessary complexity for campus-scale traffic.

Coding guidelines:
- Services return clear results/errors; API layers handle HTTP codes.
- No service importing from `app/`. One-directional dependency flow.
- Use DTOs/shape objects between layers if APIs grow.

## Key features
- **Required-by-default form** in `src/app/tickets/new/page.js` so requests are complete from the start.
- **Category ‚Üí Sub-Category** dependent dropdowns for cleaner data.
- **Activity log** in `src/models/Activity.js` for every important change.
- **Email alerts** (create/update) wired in API:
  - `src/app/api/tickets/[id]/route.js`
- **Admin screen** to view and act on tickets.

## Roles & permissions
- **Reporter**: create and view their tickets.
- **Technician**: update status of tickets assigned to them (cannot close).
- **Admin**: assign, change priority, resolve, close, view all.

## How to run
```bash
# From ticket_system/
npm install
npm run dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

- Create ticket: `http://localhost:3000/tickets/new`
- Admin area: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

## Configure email (SMTP)
Create `ticket_system/.env.local`:

```env
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SMTP for emails
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
SMTP_PORT=587            # use 465 if SSL
SMTP_USER=your_user
SMTP_PASS=your_pass
SMTP_FROM="Ticket System <no-reply@yourdomain.com>"
```

Emails are sent using `src/lib/mail.js`. In dev, if SMTP vars are missing, emails are skipped with a console warning.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No emails arrive**
  - Check `.env.local` values; try port `465` with SSL if your provider needs it.
  - Restart dev server after changing env: stop, then `npm run dev`.
  - See server logs for lines starting with `[mail]`.
- **Build error: Cannot resolve 'nodemailer'**
  - Run `npm install` in `ticket_system/` and restart dev.
- **Form won‚Äôt submit**
  - All fields are mandatory. Pick a Category before Sub-Category.

## FAQ
- **Where are models?** `src/models/` (`Ticket.js`, `User.js`, `Activity.js`).
- **Where are APIs?** `src/app/api/` (create at `tickets/route.js`, updates at `tickets/[id]/route.js`).
- **Who gets emails?** Reporter and all admins.
- **What builds the title?** We auto-generate from the first 100 chars of the description on create.

## üì® Email Magic
- Utility: `src/lib/mail.js` (Nodemailer).
  - `POST /api/tickets` ‚Üí on create
  - `PATCH /api/tickets/[id]` ‚Üí on assign/status/priority change
- Recipients: reporter + all admins. Includes details + a ticket link built from `APP_BASE_URL`.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting (Drama Detox)
- **Module not found: 'nodemailer'** ‚Üí run `npm install` in `ticket_system/`, then restart `npm run dev`.
- **No emails** ‚Üí verify `.env.local` SMTP vars; check server logs for `[mail]` warnings.
- **Form won‚Äôt submit** ‚Üí all fields are mandatory; choose a Category before Sub-Category.
